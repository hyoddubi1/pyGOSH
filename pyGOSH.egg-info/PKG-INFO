# pyGOSH: Python library for Global Optmization and SHallow machine learning

This library has functions as belows

- Clustering
    - Kmeans: K-means clustering
    - SOM: Self-Organizing Map
    - GMM: Gaussian mixture model
    
- Global Optimization (GO)
    - Optimizer: global optimization algorithms that allows any costom objective function; it is based on the Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) algorithm structure
        - DE: Differential evolution 
        - CCE: Competitive complex evolution (in SCE-UA)
        - MCCE: Modified CCE (in SP-UCI)
        
- RFECVSVR
    - RFE: Recursive Feature elimination (with Cross-Validation)
    - GRIDRFE: RFE with parameter tuning of SVR by Grid searching
	- GORFE: RFE with paramter tuning of SVR by GO
	- MOSGOSVR: MOdel Selection with Global Optimization for SVR
    
## How to Use?

Execution example will be added soon
