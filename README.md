# GOShLearnpy: Python library for Global Optmization and Shallow machine learning

This library has functions as belows

- Clustering
    - Kmeans: K-means clustering
    - SOM: Self-Organizing Map
    - GMM: Gaussian mixture model
    
- GlobalOptimization
    - Optimizer: global optimization algorithm optimizer; it is based on the Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) algorithm structure
        - DE: Differential evolution
        - CCE: Competitive complex evolution
        - MCCE: Modified CCE
        
- RFECVSVR
    - RFE: Recursive Feature elimination (with Cross-Validation)
    - GRIDRFE: RFE with Grid searching
    
Execution example will be added soon
